## Tech Stack

- **Vite + React** — fast dev setup, no fluff
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — utility-first styling
- **React Router v7** — client-side routing between the two screens
- **Lucide React** — icons throughout the UI
- **Pravatar.cc** — placeholder avatars (no signup needed, just a URL)

## Screens
