## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open  the port its running on.

## Tech Stack I used 

- **Vite + React** — fast dev setup, no fluff
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — utility-first styling
- **React Router v7** — client-side routing between the two screens
- **Lucide React** — icons throughout the UI
- **Pravatar.cc** — placeholder avatars (no signup needed, just a URL)

## Screens

| Route | Page |
|---|---|
| `/` | People — employee grid |
| `/timesheet` | Timesheet — stats + data table |
